 This repository contains scripts that I have used to analyze a large
 database of historical images of glaciers. The first script 
 "nsidc-scraper.py" accesses the National Snow and Ice Data Center 
 website and scaper all the images of the Alaskan Glaciers and adds 
 the metadata for these images to the metadata csv file. The second
 file "glac_citation.py" creates an image citation for each image when
 prompted with the Digital File ID for a specific image.
